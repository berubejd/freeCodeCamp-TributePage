              <p>The Vault Boy character is Vault-Tec's mascot and is a recurring element in 
                Vault-Tec products in the game world.  This includes the Pip-Boy, where the 
                Vault Boy illustrates all of the character statistics and selectable 
                attributes.  From Bethesda's Fallout 3 release onward Vault Boy models all of the 
                clothing and weaponry as well.</p>
              <p>The character was originally designed by <a target="_blank"
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Boyarsky">Leonard Boyarsky</a>, 
               based partly on Rich Uncle Pennybags' aesthetic from the Monopoly board game,
               and drawn for Fallout by George Almond for the first few 
               cards and by Tramell Ray Isaac, who finalized the look of the character.</p>
